install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("wrathofquan/sul.wp")
```

## Authenticate with Redivis/BigQuery 
## Instructions on how to access your token: https://apidocs.redivis.com/authorization

#redivis_auth("your-api-token")
```


### Retrieve Articles by Year 

```{r}

## Get an entire year of articles

df_1999 <- get_articles_year("1999")

head(df_blm)

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
